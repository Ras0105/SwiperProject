# SwiperProject

A **practice-focused project** built to explore and understand the real-world usage of **Swiper.js** by creating a dynamic, user-driven image slider using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Users can upload any number of images and instantly generate a responsive carousel enhanced with a **futuristic HUD-style UI**.  
This project was created specifically to **practice Swiper.js integration, configuration, and lifecycle handling** in a clean, modular setup.
